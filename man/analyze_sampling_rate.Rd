\title{Analyze Sampling Rates for Eye-Tracking Data}
\usage{
analyze_sampling_rate(eye_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{eye_data}{A dataframe containing eye-tracking data with columns `subject`, `trial`, and `time`.
The column `time` should represent the time in milliseconds for each trial.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{overall_median_SR}{The overall median sampling rate (Hz).}
  \item{overall_sd_SR}{The overall standard deviation of sampling rates.}
  \item{median_SR_by_subject}{A dataframe with the median sampling rate by subject.}
  \item{SR_by_trial}{A dataframe with the sampling rate by subject and trial.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the sampling rate for each subject and trial in an eye-tracking dataset.
It provides overall statistics, including the median and standard deviation of sampling rates,
and also generates a histogram of median sampling rates by subject, with a density plot overlayed,
and a vertical line showing the overall median sampling rate and the standard deviation displayed.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assuming eye_data is a dataframe with appropriate columns
  result <- analyze_sampling_rate(eye_data)
  print(result)
}
