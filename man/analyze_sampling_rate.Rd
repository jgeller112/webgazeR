\title{Analyze Sampling Rates for Eye-Tracking Data}
\usage{
analyze_sampling_rate(eye_data, summary_stat = "median")
}
\arguments{
\item{eye_data}{A dataframe containing eye-tracking data with columns `subject`, `trial`, and `time`.
The column `time` should represent the time in milliseconds for each trial.}

\item{summary_stat}{A character string indicating the summary statistic to use. Must be either `"median"`
(default) or `"mean"`.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{overall_summary_SR}{The overall mean or median sampling rate (Hz).}
  \item{overall_sd_SR}{The standard deviation of the sampling rate.}
  \item{summary_SR_by_subject}{A dataframe with the mean or median sampling rate by subject.}
  \item{SR_by_trial}{A dataframe with the sampling rate by subject and trial.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the sampling rate for each subject and trial in an eye-tracking dataset.
Users can specify whether to compute the mean or median sampling rate. It provides overall statistics,
including the selected measure and standard deviation, and generates a histogram of sampling rates.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assuming eye_data is a dataframe with appropriate columns
  result <- analyze_sampling_rate(eye_data, summary_stat = "mean")
  print(result)
