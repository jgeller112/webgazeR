\title{Calculate Out-of-Bounds Proportion by Subject and Trial}
\usage{
gaze_oob(
  data,
  subject_col = "subject",
  trial_col = "trial",
  x_col = "x",
  y_col = "y"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing gaze data.}

\item{subject_col}{A string specifying the name of the column that contains the subject identifier. Default is "subject".}

\item{trial_col}{A string specifying the name of the column that contains the trial identifier. Default is "trial".}

\item{x_col}{A string specifying the name of the column that contains the X coordinate. Default is "x_pred_normalised".}

\item{y_col}{A string specifying the name of the column that contains the Y coordinate. Default is "y_pred_normalised".}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
\describe{
  \item{subject_results}{Summary of missingness at the subject level, including total trials, total points, and percentages.}
  \item{trial_results}{Summary of missingness at the trial level, including total points, and percentages.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the number and percentage of gaze points that fall outside a specified range (0,1)
for both X and Y coordinates, grouped by subject and trial.
